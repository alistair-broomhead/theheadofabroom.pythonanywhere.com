                <a href="/experiments/exploder">Exploder</a> was a simple exercise to polish
                my understanding of JavaScript's prototypical inheritance model
                while learning to make use the html5 canvas element. I took
                simplistic code from an online tutorial, <a href="http://www.html5canvastutorials.com/labs/html5-canvas-ultimate-flash-killer/">here</a>,
                deconstructed it, and then put it back together as a set of
                objects that allowed for extension, such as dynamic resizing and
                support for multi-touch.

                <a href="/experiments/message">Message</a> was an experiment in putting together a
                micro-framework for generating html content - I wanted to see wht I could
                achieve while minimising external dependencies to just bottle. While somewhat
                successful, the context management approach I followed with this framework
                did not seem as clean or elegant as relying on jinja2, as I have for the rest of
                this site.
